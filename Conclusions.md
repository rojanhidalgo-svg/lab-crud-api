While working on this project, I ran into a lot of errors. At first, Postman kept showing Cannot POST /api/students%0A which turned out to be a problem with the URL I typed. I also had issues with the database connection. 
I changed ports and got SSL errors like WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER, and sometimes the server just refused to connect. On top of that, I had trouble with Git, like when it said git not recognized or remote origin already exists.
Even though it was frustrating, I learned how to fix routing problems in Express, connect MySQL properly, and push my project to GitHub. I realized that most of the mistakes were small things (like wrong URLs or setup steps) 
but they taught me how to debug better. This activity really helped me understand CRUD APIs more clearly and gave me practice solving real errors.
